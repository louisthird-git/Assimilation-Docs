# Outstanding Issues and Planned Features

The outstanding issues that need to be fixed and features that are planned for subsequent releases.

Higher priority issues are placed near the top of lists.

## 🐞 Prioritized Issues (these will roll off when included in a release)

* [SKK Combat Stalkers](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57842) only uses Friend/Enemy factions.  Thus, if you are Raider assimilated and Raiders spawn to come after you, then they will be your enemy which doesn't make sense.  Not sure how to fix this one as I cannot add the Combat Stalkers enemy faction into your friends because then (in Raider example) Super-mutants that spawn will be your friend. Challenging, no known solution.  
* Hair stretching out and actor disappearing on AAF animations.  This is not an issue with this mod and looks like it involves the timing of hair changes, but I would love to find a workaround.  Challenging, no known solution.
