If the player health falls below a configurable value or after the player romances a partner of a particular faction or after using a hotkey, there is a chance that the player's clothes, hair, body, skin, face, and faction may be changed.  The chance for a change to happen for each body section and for each faction is configurable through MCM.  

* Clothes \- Your clothes will be changed to something appropriate for that faction.  Expect to get a harness for Raiders and a suit for Triggermen.  There are differences for male and female characters.  There is an option to swap your clothing hats/helmets when combat starts/ends and an option to swap your clothing gas mask when bad weather starts/ends.  I could tell you what all the apparel possibilities are, but that would take away the fun and surprise.  Currently, base game/DLC apparel is supported plus the following mods:  
  * [Harness Wardrobe](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2227) \- Raiders  
  * [Militarized Minutemen](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29853) \- Minutemen  
  * [Wearable Super Mutant Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42258) \- Super Mutants  
  * [Gunner Outfit Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43686) \- Gunners  
  * [ToneTigre Slave Clothes](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48685) \- Raiders / Super Mutants  
  * [Kharneth Slave Clothes](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53918) \- Raiders / Super Mutants  
  * More can easily be added\!  Which ones would you like?  
* Hair \- Your hair will be changed to something appropriate for that faction.  Expect to get a mohawk for Raiders and a military cut Gunners.  There are differences for male and female characters.  Supported hair, beard, and pubic hair styles will also regrow over time or fall out from radiation.  There are some penalties if your hair gets too long so you should find & drop some scissors on the ground and use them (outside of combat) to trim up to avoid them (the scissors may break\!).  I could tell you what all the hairstyle possibilities are, but that would take away the fun and surprise.  Currently, base game/DLC hairstyles are supported plus the following mods:  
  * [Ponytail Hairstyles v3.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8126) (note that v2.5a no longer supported)  
  * [ANiceOakTree's Hairstyles](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25536)  
  * [Pubes Forever](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46854)  
  * [Commonwealth Cuts](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11402)  
  * [KS Hairdos](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45373)  
  * [KS Hairdos with Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29944)  
  * More can easily be added\!  Which ones would you like?  
* Body \- Your CBBE or FusionGirl body will be morphed based on settings in MCM.  Configure them as you see fit, but by default it is set for female characters making the breasts and butt bigger and the waist smaller, i.e. an hourglass figure for most factions except "settler" factions which are the opposite.  It is possible to configure the settings for male and female characters.  
  * FEV \- If you romance a super-mutant, then some FEV may sneak into your system and cause increased muscle mass and some increased strength side-effects.  Beware\!  (This can be configured or disabled in MCM).  
  * Actions Effect Body \- Similar to mods like WTTF. You eat \- you get large, You swing & bash & workout \- you get muscle, You lounge & get rads \- you get thin (can be configured or disabled in MCM).  
  * Metabolism \- If you don't eat/exercise your body grows thinner by a small, balanced, configurable amount over time... like real people.  
  * Walking/Standing-Still Bonus option \- To aid in surviving while in faction, you get a tiny heal bonus while walking or standing still.  
  * Noise Option \- There is an option that player makes noise when swinging, bashing, jumping, or swimming.  
* Skin \- If certain mods are installed, then tattoos can be applied to the entire body  
  * Once across entire body when first affected if [Random Overlay Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14263-random-overlay-framework/) is installed  
  * Thereafter one after romance, combat defeat or helping faction members  
* Face \- Your face can have tattoos or damage applied to it.  
  * Uses [Scripted Face Tints (SFT)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/76797)  
  * Create Medicated Face Wipes aid item that can erase one face damage tint (can be an aid gift).  
* Faction (version 3.0 and greater) \- Your faction will be changed to that faction and possibly moved to a faction-friendly location.  Your last partner will have a small dialogue to initiate it.  You will remain in the faction until you help or romance enough faction members to leave the faction.  When leaving, a small dialogue allows you to confirm leaving or remaining in the faction.  While assimilated to the faction, you will gain a perk appropriate for that faction.  Asking to help or romancing faction members may result in them offering gifts or to be a companion (up to 2).  You will receive better gifts based on your faction reputation which increases each time non-faction members are killed.  It can decrease as well\!  
  * Talking to faction members using an assigned hotkey allows you to ask for info, request gifts, offer help, or romance them.  After talking, some faction members may be a doctor and can help heal you.  
  * Alternate Ending quest \- If not assimilated to a faction (chance failed), then there is a chance that an alternate ending quest can occur, mostly romantic but depending on the outcome of a small dialog can be other things (if installed) like being Bound In Public or POTC or Real Handcuffed or even Caps taken, etc.  
  * Overseer quest \- get assigned a random faction Overseer (and possibly shock collared) to check-in with on your progress or be punished.  
  * Late to Overseer quest \- Overseer sends a group of faction members to track you down and bring you back to them.  
  * The following Assimilation Help Quests are supported for earning payback to get out of the faction (all included with Assimilation unless linked):  
    * Ammunition  
    * Beer Run  
    * Feed Me\!  
    * Kissing Booth  
    * Milk of Human Kindness  
    * Rival Raider Return  
    * Signed, Sealed, Delivered  
    * Takedown  
    * Village Bicycle  
    * Watered Down  
  * NOTE: Some details on implementation here: To make other factions hate the player if they become a Raider, those factions must be modified to dislike the player.  The faction relations are saved before faction assimilation and restored after un-assimilation, but there is some risk here if they never get restored properly.  I have been careful to assure that doesn't happen in the scripts, but that said I would only play version 3.0 with faction assimilation enabled on a new game not your long-term game with 1000's of hours played.  
  * Post a comment if you notice an NPC is unexpectedly a friend or enemy after faction assimilation and I can likely fix it.
   
NOTE: There is no quick undo for the changes once they happen.  If the player's hair changes, then you're going to have to see John in Diamond City or Horatio in Vault 81 to get a new hairstyle.  If the player's body or skin changes, then you're going to have to see Doc Crocker in Diamond City to fix it.  You can put your other clothes back on if you don't like the ones given to you (the mod doesn't remove them), or some may play with mods where all your clothes are stripped, and then the changed clothes will be the only ones you have\!  There are easy ways to change all of these with the showlooksmenu command, but role playing and continuing with whatever changes is more interesting.
